What is Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are models of code that solve classic problems. They are solutions to software design problems that you can find in a real-world application. A Design Pattern is not a code that is ready to be used in your application, but it is a model that you can use to solve a problem.
Design patterns are language neutral, so they can be applied to any language that supports object-orientation.
